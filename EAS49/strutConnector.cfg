	description = A child of one of the engineers at Aquila, upon seeing the need for multiple EAS-17's, recently asked, "Daddy, why don't you just make it bigger?". Soon, plans for an even stronger strut appeared. 100x stronger than the EAS-4. Once both sides are connected, a structural beam is created to link both ends, allowing for sturdier (and heavier) construction.
