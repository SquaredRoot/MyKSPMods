	description = Have you ever thought... "Needs More Struts?" Well look no further! The EAS-17 "SuperStrut" is 10 times stronger than the standard strut, decreasing the amount of struts by 10. Currently using a recolored placeholder model. Once both sides are connected, a structural beam is created to link both ends, allowing for sturdier (and heavier) construction.
