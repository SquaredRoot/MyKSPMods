I really don't know what to license this as as it is a mod for creating modified copies of stock parts, so credit goes to Squad (specifically HarvestR) for the most part.
But the bit that I did? That's mine. That's right. That recolored stock texture, that extra decimal place-- All mine.
You may not make anyone pay for this mod or host this mod without my knowledge and consent, and you must ask permission if you wish to redistribute, even a modified version. If you want to modify it for personal use-- Go ahead.
