	description = Once Aquila's management realized MonstKerb could be mixed with Red KerBull for even greater amounts of kaffene, they immediately started to spike workers' koffee with it. This hybrid fuel line/strut is the brainchild of a hyped-up Kerbal who realized that the hollow kerbon nanotube structure of the EAS-343 was perfect for holding fluids when he knocked over his koffee into one.
